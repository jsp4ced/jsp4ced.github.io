My PhD thesis is now available on <a href='https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-512834'>DiVA</a> - please contact me if you would like a signed copy! There are some pictures from the "spikning" (old-fashioned posting of the thesis in Sweden by nailing it) on the IRF website: <a href='https://www.irf.se/sv/news/2023/11/02/joshua-dreyer-spikade-doktorsavhandling-material-fran-saturnus-d-ring-i-fokus/'>Swedish</a>/<a href='https://www.irf.se/en/news/2023/11/02/joshua-dreyer-nailed-his-doctoral-thesis-material-from-saturns-d-ring-in-focus/'>English</a>.
