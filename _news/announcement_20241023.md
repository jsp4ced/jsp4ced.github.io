I'll present my current research on producing global VTEC maps from GNSS data with median polish kriging and their application to the geomagnetic storm in May 2024 (<a href='https://www.joshuadreyer.com/assets/video/Global_VTEC_Median_Polish_Kriging_DOY_130-132_8fps_ds.mp4'>Video for DOY 130-132</a> and corresponding <a href='https://www.joshuadreyer.com/assets/video/Storm_Effect_VTEC_Comparison_DOY131-132_w_DOY116-129.mp4'>changes due to the storm</a>) at the <a href='https://esww2024.org'>European Space Weather Week</a> in Coimbra. Stop by my poster in OPS2 if you're there!
