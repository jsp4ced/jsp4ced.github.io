Hej, thanks for visiting my corner of the internet! 

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Royal Observatory of Belgium (<a href='https://www.astro.oma.be/en/'>ROB</a>), where I study Earth's ionosphere and its coupling to space using GNSS data. Previously, my PhD at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and Uppsala University was focused on Saturn's low-latitude ionosphere using Cassini data and photochemical modelling. I'm also interested in all kinds of auroral research, planetary science and everything that could reasonably be classified as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronomy'>aeronomy</a>. Because it's a fun and severely underused term, I like to use aeronomer as my job description.

Check out my <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/publications/'>publications</a> for more info about my research! You can also visit the <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/'>projects</a> page to learn more about fragmented aurora-like emissions (<a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/FAEs/'>FAEs</a>) or see some of my aurora and travel photography. 

Outside of academia, I'm passionate about the great outdoors (especially the cold and remote corners of this Earth), game nights, movies, music, histroy, travel, and coffee.
