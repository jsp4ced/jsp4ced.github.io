Hej, thanks for visiting my corner of the internet! 

I am a PhD student at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics (<a href='https://www.irf.se/sv/kontakt/kontakt-uppsala/'>IRF</a>) and Uppsala University, where I study Saturn's low-latitude ionosphere using Casssini data and photochemical modelling. I'm also interested in all kinds of auroral research and everything that could reasonably be classified as aeronomy. Because it's a fun and severely underused term, I like to use aeronomer as my job description.

Check out my publications for more info about my research! You can also visit the projects page to learn more about fragmented aurora-like emissions (FAEs) or see some of my aurora and travel photography. 

Outside of academia, I'm passionate about the great outdoors (especially the cold corners of this Earth), board and RP games, music, travel and coffee.
